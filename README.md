Although I did complete 'all' the assignments, the final work wasn't up to par with standards.
All greens should be solved. Some yellows and reds.
None of the extra assignments have been completed.

#### Tuesday

This assignment felt weird to me. I did complete all the objectives,
although the format of the assignment was strange. It's was hard
to tell where I should put comments and pictures in the document.

Also the wizard the assignment kept mentioning didn't show up. Had the figure it out manually.

The program itself reflects this. It's messy.
Only got messier when they told us to clutter the project further with each step.

#### Wednesday

REST:

All tests

I created all the CRUD endpoints, although update stopped working after the 'Entity with relations' part.
Although it does exist, it just creates duplicates instead of merging.
I completed the green part of the exception handling. I honestly just used the classes from the slide. Should be functional.
The resource tests got messed up after 'Entity with relations'.  I simplified them and they still made problems despite the fact that the endpoints works in postman. Ended up outcommenting them entirely.


I didn't create the Persons(plural)DTO class, simply because it isn't necessary. See implementation of endpoint /all
